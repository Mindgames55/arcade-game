# Project Title

Arcade game

## How to Play

The main goal of the game is to score the highest amount of points as possible by collecting gems and stars. Try to avoid colliding with
the moving bugs while collecting the items. You have 3 lives (hearts). Now, if you loose them all you loose your points as well, so it is up to you when to stop collecting (scoring) items and to grab the key which finishes the game. Every gem has a different behavior. Go and play to discover what every one of those gems does, and again watch out with the BUGS :)

### What you'll need

Good news! you just need a browser and the ability to move your fingers fast :D
